Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel. 
All claimed that they were the best. The most important.The most useful.The favorite
Green said: "Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and of hope. 
I was chosen for grass, trees and leaves. Without me, all animals would die. 
Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority."
Blue interrupted: "You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea. 
It is the water that is the basis of life and drawn up by the clouds from the deep sea.
 The sky gives space and peace and serenity. Without my peace, you would all be nothing."
